Printing Instructions

Option A: Print your own

1. Line up your 16 finished pages side-by-side in booklet format.

2. Print the sheets back-to-back, and trim the top and bottom borders.

3. Use a long-arm stapler to stitch the center line.

4. Fold and trim the open side.

Option B: Don't print your own

1. Take your 16-page document to a print shop, and have them print it as a booklet on 100lb Gloss Text paper. It should come out great!
