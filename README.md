Printing Instructions

Option A: Print your own

1. Line up your 16 finished pages side-by-side in booklet-format:

Sheet Number (Front or Back): Page Number (Left or Right)
1F:  16 / 1
1B: 2 / 15
2F: 14 / 3
2B: 4 / 13
3F: 12 / 5
3B: 6 / 11
4F: 10 / 7
4B: 8 / 9

2. Print and trim the sheets back-to-back.

3. Use a long-arm stapler to stitch the center line.

4. Fold and final-trim the open side.

Option B: Don't print your own

1. Take your 16-page document to a print shop, and have them print it as a booklet on 100lb Gloss Text paper. It should come out great!
